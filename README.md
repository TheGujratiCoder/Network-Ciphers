# Network-Ciphers

## INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY: AN OVERVIEW

### Understanding The Landscape
=> Information Security is the practice of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

=> Network Security is a crucial subset of information security focused on safeguarding networks and associated systems, devices, and data from cyberattacks.

### Key Security Objectives
1) Confidentiality: Ensuring data privacy and accessibility only to authorized individuals or systems.

2) Integrity: Protecting data from unauthorized modification or tampering, maintaining its accuracy and completeness.

3) Availability: Guaranteeing timely and reliable access to data and system resources for authorized users.

This is known as the CIA triad which are the basic pillars of Information and Network Security (INS).

### Common Threrts and Risks

1) Malware: Malicious software programs like viruses, worms, and ransomware designed to harm systems or steal data.

2) Cyberattacks: Intentional attempts to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to networks or systems.

3) Data Breaches: Unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information, often due to security failures or human error.

4) Social Engineering: Manipulative tactics used to trick users into revealing confidential information or granting access.

5) Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Overwhelming systems with traffic to render them unavailable to legitimate users.

### Fundamental Security Principles

1) Defense in Depth: Implementing multiple layers of security controls to provide protection even if one layer fails.

2) Least Privilege: Granting users only the access and permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

3) Patch Management: Regularly updating software and systems to address security vulnerabilities.

4) Data Encryption: Transforming data into an unreadable format to protect it during transmission or storage.

5) User Awareness and Training: Educating users about security risks and best practices.

## NETWORK CIPHERS - IN DEPTH EXPLANATION

### What are Network Ciphers ? 

=> Network Ciphers are secure algorithms used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted over networks, safeguarding it from unauthorized interception or alteration.

=> Ciphers employ secret keys or passwords to scramble data, making it unintelligible without the correct key.

### Types of Network Ciphers

1) Symmetric Ciphers: Use the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, Blowfish).

2) Asymmetric Ciphers: Employ separate public and private keys (e.g., RSA, ECC).

3) Stream Ciphers: Encrypt data continuously in bit-wise or byte-wise fashion (e.g., RC4).

4) Block Ciphers: Encrypt data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., AES).

## Popular Network Ciphers Explained

1) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):

A symmetric block cipher widely used for government and commercial applications due to its strong security and efficiency.

3) ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):

An asymmetric cipher based on elliptic curves, gaining popularity due to its smaller key sizes and faster performance compared to RSA for equivalent security levels.

6) TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer):

Protocols using various ciphers to secure communication over networks, commonly used for HTTPS websites and other secure connections.

## Key Considerations for Choosing Network Ciphers

=> Security Strength: The cipher's ability to resist known attacks and withstand cryptanalysis.

=> Performance: The impact of encryption/decryption on network speed and processing power.

=> Key Management: The complexity and security of key generation, distribution, and storage.

=>Standardization: Adherence to widely recognized standards for compatibility and interoperability.

# CONCLUSION

INS has become critical in today's digital environment. You may safeguard your data and systems by taking well-informed judgements based on your knowledge of network cypher nuances, dangers, and best practices.
